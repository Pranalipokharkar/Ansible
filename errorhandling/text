Playbook Review

Installing Security Updates:
This task installs the latest versions of openssl and openssh, which are critical security packages. Using ignore_errors: yes ensures that even if one package fails to update, the playbook continues.

Checking Docker Installation:
The task checks if Docker is installed by running docker --version. The ignore_errors: yes ensures that the playbook doesn't fail if Docker is not installed.

Debugging Output:
The debug task prints the result of the Docker version check, which is useful for troubleshooting.

Installing Docker Conditionally:
Docker is installed only if the docker --version command failed, which indicates Docker is not installed.
